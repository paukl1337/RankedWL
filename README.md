I made this program to get the wins, losses, and elo/elo rank of a player using the MCSR Ranked API. 

(IF U LOOK AT THE CODE I AM SORRY FOR THE FORMATTING I'M SORRY FOR MY LACK OF COMMENTS I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING 
   I ALSO HAVE NEVER USED GITHUB BEFORE SO SORRY IF SOMETHING IS BAD...)

USAGE:
I suggest that u create a new folder and place this file in there
install java 15+ if you don't have it already
if u enter an invalid name the file will just stop working so if u do that just close and reopen it

rest should be pretty simple :D
