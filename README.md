I made this program to get the wins, losses, and elo/elo rank of a player using the MCSR Ranked API. 

(IF U LOOK AT THE CODE I AM SORRY FOR THE FORMATTING I'M SORRY FOR MY LACK OF COMMENTS I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING 
   I ALSO HAVE NEVER USED GITHUB BEFORE SO SORRY IF SOMETHING IS BAD...)

USAGE:
I suggest that u create a new folder and place this file in there

1) install java 15+ if you don't have it already
2) create a .bat file and inside put something like this:
   
`"C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.7.7-hotspot\bin\java" -jar "D:\Downloads\RankedWL.jar"`

where you need to change the java path to wherever you have java installed to, and the rankedwl path 

rest should be pretty simple :D
